/**
 * For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. 
 * The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum 
 * height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find 
 * all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.
 * 
 * The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be given the number n and 
 * a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).
 * 
 * You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is 
 * the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
 * 
 * Example 1 :
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
 * 
 *         0
 *         |
 *         1
 *        / \
 *       2   3 
 * 
 * Output: [1]
 * Example 2 :
 * 
 * Input: n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]
 * 
 *      0  1  2
 *       \ | /
 *         3
 *         |
 *         4
 *         |
 *         5 
 * 
 * Output: [3, 4]
 * 
 * Solution is either one or two nodes in the center of the tree. We use Kahnâ€™s algorithm and peel off
 * leaves in each iteration what remains is either one node or two nodes in the center.
 * 
 * Complexity is O(V + E).
