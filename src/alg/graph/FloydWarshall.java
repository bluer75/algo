/**
 * Floyd Warshall algorithm.
 * This algorithm allows to find the shortest path between all vertices in the weighted graph.
 * It works with both directed and undirected graphs, but it does not work along with the graph with negative cycles.
 * This algorithm follows the dynamic programming approach and uses adjacency matrix D that gives the length of the
 * shortest path between each pair of nodes. The matrix is initialized with direct distances between nodes, and then it
 * does n iterations, after iteration k, D gives the length of the shortest paths that only use nodes in {1,2â€¦.k} as
 * intermediate nodes. After n iterations, D, therefore, gives the length of the shortest paths using any of the nodes
 * in graph as an intermediate node. If Dk represents the matrix D after kth iteration it can be implemented by:
 * Dk[i, j] = min (Dk-1[i, j], Dk-1[i, k] + Dk-1[k, j])
 *
 * Time complexity is O(n^3)
 * Space complexity is O(n^2)
